# Classifier-to-predict-digits
I've created a Random Forest Classifier to predict digits from the famous "digits" dataset using scikit-learn.
This dataset consists of images of handwritten digits (0-9) and their corresponding labels. Here I provide you with an explanation of my code and the steps I've taken to create and evaluate the model.

1 Data Loading and Exploration: - I load the "digits" dataset using scikit-learn's load_digits() function. - I print the shape of the input and output datasets to understand their dimensions. - I display the first input image to get an idea of the data.

2 Data Preprocessing: - I check the shape of the first image and the total number of samples. - I create a 2D data array by reshaping the 8x8 images into 64-dimensional vectors. - I normalize the data by dividing it by 16, which scales the pixel values to the range [0, 1].

3 Train-Test Split: - I split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.

4 Random Forest Model: - I create a Random Forest Classifier (rf) and fit it to the training data (X_train, y_train).

5 Model Evaluation: - I make predictions on the test data using rf.predict(X_test) and store the predictions in y_pred. - I compute and display a confusion matrix to understand how many true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives there are for each digit. - I calculate the accuracy of the model using accuracy_score and print it. - I generate a classification report that includes precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each digit class, and I print it.

6 Prediction: - I make predictions on new data (X_test) using the trained model and store the results in y_pred.
